## Data Sets for Independent/Group Projects

  We would like to provide you with the opportunity to use R to automate the manipulation, analysis, and visualization of your own data 
  set.  You may work alone or in groups. Start by making a directory for your analysis, then copy your data to that directory and make a 
  new R script to process the data. Try to complete all data processing, analysis, and visualization in R (and bash).
  
  If you were not able to bring your own data set, we will provide you with the option of analyzing any one of the data sets below that are
  provided with the book, Computing Skills for Biologists.  Please see the file, R_ProjectData.pdf for descriptions and ideas on what to  
  do with the data.
